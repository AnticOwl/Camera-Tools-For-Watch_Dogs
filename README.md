# Camera-Tools-Photomode-For-Watch_Dogs
This is a tool that allows you to control the camera for Watch_Dogs, and allows you to control many other elements of the Disrupt engine to allow for a definitive "picture mode". 
# Features
1- Control the camera including the field of view and camera roll. 
2- Control the depth of field, with two modes allowing you to blur near objects and/or objects in the distance.
3- Control the time of day as well as the weather preset. 
4- Freeze and slow down the game.
5- UI/HUD Toggle. 
6- Super rendering Toggle, which renders the game at an extreme quality only seen in pre rendered cutscene.  This toggle assumes you are already running the game on Ultra settings.
# Acknowledgments
This project uses a function coded by github.com/yubie-re in order to allow me to change read/write protections in certain memory regions protected by the game's DRM.
