# Camera-Tools/Photomode For Watch_Dogs
This is a tool that allows you to control the camera for Watch_Dogs, and allows you to control many other elements of the Disrupt engine to allow for a definitive "picture mode" for taking screenshots. <br /> 
The files in Binaries go in your gamedir/bin where your Watch_Dogs executable (.exe) is. 
# Important Notes
• This was hard-coded for the current latest version of Watch_Dogs for Ubisoft Connect/Uplay. This will not work with any other version of the game. <br /> 
• If you have the Watch_Dogs on Steam, backup your original Disrupt_b64.dll, and replace it with the one included in the Binaries Folder. The DLLs don't have any real differneces in terms of functionality.  <br /> 
• If you are using a cracked version of Watch_Dogs, replacing Disrupt_b64.dll may or may not break your crack, as some cracks are included directly in the Disrupt DLL.
# Features
• Control the camera including the field of view and camera roll. <br /> 
• Control the depth of field, with two modes allowing you to blur near objects and/or objects in the distance. <br /> 
• Control the time of day as well as the weather preset. <br /> 
• Freeze and slow down the game. <br /> 
• UI/HUD Toggle.  <br /> 
• Super Rendering Toggle, which renders the game at an extreme quality only seen in pre rendered cutscene.  This toggle assumes you are already running the game on Ultra settings.

This project uses a function coded by github.com/yubie-re in order to allow me to change read/write protections in certain memory regions protected by the game's DRM.
